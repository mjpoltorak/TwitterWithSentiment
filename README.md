# TwitterWithSentiment

# Sentiment.py
This program gets live tweets as they come in. The twitter API, tweepy, used here is much more efficient and effective as a solution as opposed to HTML parsing (one of my previous repositories). In addition to fetching live tweets, this program also analyzes the sentiment of the tweet (positive or negative). This script also live streams the incoming data into the postgres database.
Necessary libraries include: json, tweepy, textblob, sys

#PopulateDatabse.py
Please do not use this script it is currently experiencing a few bugs.

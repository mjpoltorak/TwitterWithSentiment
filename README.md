# TwitterWithSentiment

This program gets live tweets as they come in. The twitter API, tweepy, used here is much more efficient and effective as a solution as opposed to HTML parsing (one of my previous repositories). In addition to fetching live tweets, this program also analyzes the sentiment of the tweet (positive or negative). 

Necessary libraries include: json, tweepy, textblob, sys
